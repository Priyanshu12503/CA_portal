The Intelligent CA Customer Portal is a full-stack web application designed to digitalize and automate traditional Chartered Accountancy workflows. The platform streamlines client management, document handling, service tracking, invoicing, and communication through a centralized, secure, and user-friendly system.

Built using Spring Boot, React, and MySQL, the portal supports role-based dashboards, automated workflows, real-time notifications, and an integrated AI assistant to help users with tax and finance-related queries. It eliminates manual processes and enables CAs to efficiently manage clients, deadlines, compliances, and financial records.
